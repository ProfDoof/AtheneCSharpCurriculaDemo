# AtheneCSharpCurriculaDemo

TODO: Develop Walk Through to show how all Athene C# curricula should be formatted both in structure and in how to use the functions that have been developed. (Basically if they uploaded this demo curricula to Athene it should work and have 100% coverage. No useless functions please.)
